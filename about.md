Hello visitor! My name is Pam and I'm a compsci & scifi nerd living in Cedar Falls, IA.  I’m all set to graduate this spring from the University of Northern Iowa and will be in the infamous ‘job market’ soon. I’m a curious bumblebee of a person always on the lookout for a new computer or crafting rabbit hole to get lost in.
