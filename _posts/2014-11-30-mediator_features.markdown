## Iditarod race logs

As a lover of unconventional sports I adore the Iditarod dogsled race that takes place every year in Alaska. One obstacle that has always made my fandom difficult is sifting through the information heavy logs that get published in roughly half hour intervals to find just the relevant information that I want. This year when the race kicked off I decided to take care of this problem and write some code that would scrape the most recent update logs. Providing me with only the most crucial :relaxed: information and (eventually) highlighting updates from one log to the next.

## Webpage allergen search

Recently I’ve been on a journey of self discovery…….of my personal list of allergens. (huge shoutout to dermatology and allergy specialists! :clap:).  Since most allergens have a bajillion alternative names (ok maybe an exaggeration)  to look for in the ingredients list…..I found it hard to search through __*every*__ ingredient list for __*every*__ product for __*each*__ of my allergens. All of a sudden…..BOOM….it came to me “Pam…..you are a computer science guru……..get the computer to do the heavy lifting”. Couple of nights later and ta-da…voila….bazinga……….sorry, carried away…..anywho I completed my code that allows me to simply input the URL of for a product and it searches the page, returning any matches to words in my allergen master list.
