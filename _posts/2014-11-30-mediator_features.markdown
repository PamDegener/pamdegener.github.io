## Iditarod race logs

As a lover of unconventional sports I adore the Iditarod dogsled race that takes place every year in Alaska. One obstacle that has always made my fandom difficult is sifting through the information heavy logs that get published in roughly half hour intervals to find just the relevant information that I want. This year when the race kicked off I decided to take care of this problem and write some code that would scrape the most recent update logs. Providing me with only the most crucial :relaxed: information and (eventually) highlighting updates from one log to the next.
